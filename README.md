# company-news-web-scraper-hello-world
My first real program! It just scrapes a couple news sites and associates positive and negative titles
I'm going to be uploading the actual code over the next couple of days.

Honestly, I'll start out with copying info from a website manually, then having the program check it.

Also, please don't expect too much, or anything at all, really. Again, first real project.
